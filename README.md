# Wild Oasis Demo

## This is based on the starter project provided by the Udemy 'Ultimate React Course 2025' by Jonas Schmedtmann

#### The live demo is available for you to check out at https://wild-oasis-demo.netlify.app/

Having gone through the course this is the final project in which I have experimented and got to grips with the skills that I have learnt. There are several elements that I have created from scratch and extensive comment based notes within the source code. I have used it to get back up to speed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript after almost 20 years away from it. I have also discovered many finer details of developing with React along with using React-Query and supabase (along with several other libraries). The front end was designed as I went along with developing it, simply implementing skills that I learned about on the way or constructs that I wanted to feel more comfortable with.

Any feedback (including a little pat on the back) is extremely welcome, and if you find something that you'd like to copy then please feel free I'd find it an honour (but do let me know if that's ok).

Speak soon, Giles.
